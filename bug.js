This bug occurs when using the Expo Camera API with specific Android devices.  The camera preview fails to load, displaying only a black screen. This happens inconsistently, even with identical code and configurations across different devices. No error messages are logged in the console, making debugging extremely difficult. The issue might be related to the interaction between Expo's Camera API and device-specific camera hardware or drivers.  The device is a Samsung Galaxy S8 and another is a Google Pixel 6.
